Hi!

My name is Martin and I've been designing and building keyboards for a while now.
This page will both serve as my journal for my future keyboard projects but also as a documentation for my current designs.

I intend to upload and open source all my projects and you can find it on my [github](https://github.com/Martinhinnerson/lakemountain)
Everything is not there yet since i want to clean up some stuff before uploading...

If you want to contact me send me an [email](mailto:martin@hinnerson.se) or join the lakemountain-keyboards [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/eDaCSZW25q).
