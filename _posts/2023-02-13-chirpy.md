Just a quick post about what framework I'm using for this website.

The paste is hosted on github using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). A very easy to use web framework that has direct support in github.

For the theme I'm using [chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/). Aside from some slight problems hosting the page on github, it was easy to setup and port from the old default minima theme I was using.
