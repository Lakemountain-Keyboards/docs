In the last post I quickly mentioned the discussion whether to mount the LEDs south facing or north facing. Today after mounting a few more LEDs i think I will have to mount them north facing. The reason being that the LEDs are **really** intense and with the staggered layout of the keyboard you in some places get direct light in your eyes from them since the switches have a slot that lets through the light. On medium to higher brightness of the LED this becomes annoying quickly.

Here's an image trying to show that. It's not as visible on camera but you can see the flare.

Mounting the switches north-facing will remove the direct glare and also illuminate the key labels for transparent keys. The only bad thing is I now have to redo my PCB layouts ðŸ˜­
