A few years back a friend at work bought a kit for a custom mechanical keyboard. I was immediately interested in building my own, but could not find a keyboard with the specs I was looking for, at least not for the price I was willing to pay...

I'm a engineer with that likes DIY electronics projects so I decided to design my own keyboard. I did some research, and in a few months I managed to build my first custom keyboard. There was a lot of work but I'm very proud of the result and this was my daily driver at work for 1-2 years, until I made my next version.

## Specification:

* 65% ISO layout
* Custom PCB using the Elite-C microcontroller
* 3D-printed case with wrist-rest addon

My first version used through hole components to make it easy to solder everything by hand.

# Numpad

Quickly I got more interested in improving my PCB design, so I started to throw together a matching numpad with the purpose to improve my PCB design skills. I also wanted to use exclusively SMD components, integrated microcontroller and RGB backlight, just for fun... This resulted in the numpad below.

# LS65

After this I knew I wanted to make a new improved version of my first design, but at this point I had lost some motivation for this project and didn't want to put the time in since my first design was working very well. However, after a while I got back to it and on and off for about a year I worked on the LS65. As all DIY:ers know, actually finishing a project is the hardest thing. I feel like I have been very close to finishing the LS65 for a long time now, but there is always something more you want to do with it.

Anyways, here it is in all its glory!
The keycaps in the image are the [Drop katakana](https://drop.com/buy/drop-gmk-white-on-black-katakana-custom-keycap-set) set that I managed to get for a decent price on a sale.
