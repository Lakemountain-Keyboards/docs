The bottom facing LEDs of the LS65 gave a decent underglow effect when printing the case with a semi-transparent plastic. Here an image from when I was experimenting with this.

For the new lakemountain keyboard I'm thinking of adding this side-facing version of the same sk6812 LEDs that I'm adding for key backlight. I'll add these along the edge of the PCB and just connect their data lines in series with the rest of the RGB matrix. The indexing of the LEDs can be handled in software using `RGB_LED_MAP` in [qmk](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgblight?id=rgb-lighting) so that the side facing LEDs can act as a separate series.

## KiCad footprint
I didn't find any KiCad footprint files for the `sk6812side` so I made one based on the measurements of the product [specification](http://www.normandled.com/upload/201810/SK6812%20SIDE-A%20LED%20Datasheet.pdf). The pad numbering are ordered so that the same schematic symbols as the sk6812mini-e can be used for these as well.
