In the last post I talked about the `sk6812side` LEDs I'm planning to add. As I said I didn't find a kicad footprint for it so I created one. It turns out there are no 3d models of it either, have nobodey used these before?

Anyways I quickly made this in fusion based on the measurements in the [specification](http://www.normandled.com/upload/201810/SK6812%20SIDE-A%20LED%20Datasheet.pdf).

This was really not neccesary but the 3d board view of the PCB doesn't feel complete without 3d models for all components :)
